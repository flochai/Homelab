### Introduction
---

This repo contains all the configurations and documentation related to my homelab setup.

As a DevOps student, my goal is to learn by doing—and my homelab is where the magic happens. It’s my sandbox for testing, breaking, fixing, and improving. I use it to explore technologies like Kubernetes, automation tools, containerization, monitoring stacks, and more. By self-hosting applications and managing the full lifecycle—from deployment to maintenance—I gain real-world experience with backup strategies, security, scalability, and operational reliability.

This is more than just a lab—it’s my personal playground and learning portfolio.
